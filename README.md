## Description

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge that you learned previously.

- You are **not** allowed to use JavaScript.

- The final implementation must match the provided design as closely as possible.

## Tools & Technologies
